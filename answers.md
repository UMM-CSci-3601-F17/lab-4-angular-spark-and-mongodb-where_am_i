# Question Answers

1. Notice anything new in our ``.gitignore``? There are actually
multiple ``.gitignore`` files in this project. Where are they?
Why might we have more than one, and how do they interact?
    - There is a `.gitignore` file in the root of the repo, one in the `client` directory, and one in the `server` directory.
    - The one in the root is for things we want to ignore across the entire project, while the ones in the `client` and `server` directories are for items we want to only ignore for those sub-projects.
2. Note also that there are now multiple ``build.gradle`` files
as well! Why is this?
    - There is the `build.gradle` in the root of the project which just imports both sub-projects.
    - The server project has a `build.gradle` to build the Java-based server and the client project has its own `build.gradle` to handle the node and yarn stuff related to the client.
3. How does the navbar work in this project? Is our SparkJava server
the only thing doing routing?
    - The navbar component has links to the frontend pages, which are references to Angular's routes.
    - These links don't actually go to new HTML pages, but rather tell Angular what to display.
    - `app.routes.ts` contains the routes to the various pages (components) in the frontend.
    - This makes it so when you go to different URLS on the frontend, it changes the view being displayed accordingly.
    - The routing done by the Spark server is only for the API.
4. What does the `user-list.service.ts` do? Why is it not just done in
the `user-list.component.ts`?
    - The `user-list.service.ts` code defines methods that interact with the server and returns an Observeable type in response to a query
    - The reason it's not all in `user-list.component.ts` is because this is where the returned data is handled rather than declared, and it needs the `user-list.service.ts` to return that Observable type to interact with the server separately.
